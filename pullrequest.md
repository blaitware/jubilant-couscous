**Title:** Chore(sail): Dockerized with Sail

**Description:**
This PR adds Docker support to the project using Laravel Sail for streamlined local development and testing. By incorporating Docker containers managed by Sail, we can ensure consistent development environments across team members and simplify the setup process for new contributors.

**Changes Made:**
- Added `docker-compose.yml` file to define the Docker services required for the project.
- Configured Sail services for the application, database, cache, and queue.
- Updated the README with instructions for using Sail to set up the development environment.
- Included a `.env.example` file with necessary environment variables for Sail.
- Adjusted necessary configurations to work seamlessly with Sail and Docker containers.

**Testing:**
- Tested the Docker setup on multiple development environments to ensure compatibility and consistency.
- Verified that the application can be accessed and functions correctly within the Sail container environment.
- Ran the existing test suite to confirm that all tests pass successfully with the new Dockerized setup.

**Screenshots:**
[Optional: If applicable, provide screenshots of the application running within the Dockerized environment.]

**Additional Notes:**
By Dockerizing the project with Sail, we aim to enhance the development experience, foster collaboration, and reduce onboarding friction for new developers. This change aligns with our goal of maintaining a robust and standardized development environment.
